## Overview

[chainrxn.arysriv.com](https://chainrxn.arysriv.com/) is a functioning multiplayer game built in SvelteKit. It focuses on fast, reactive play and a shared game state so players can interact in real time.

## What I Did

I designed and implemented the multiplayer loop, client interactions, and real-time state updates. The project explores how far SvelteKit can be pushed for game-like experiences in the browser.

## Highlights

- Real-time multiplayer sessions
- Lightweight, responsive UI
- Built end-to-end with SvelteKit
