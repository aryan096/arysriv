        'In 2020, we all witnessed the consequences of immense polarization in US society and the existence of echo chambers on social media platforms garnered special attention by people on both ends of the political spectrum, and the media. However, in the scientific community, there is still some debate about the existence of these chambers and how big of a role they play in super-charging polarization.' +
        'As a research project for a class I took in Fall 2020 (**Collective Cognition** in the CLPS department), I wanted to study whether certain political subreddits on Reddit portrayed characteristics of echo-chambers and to what extent. \n\n' +
        'I used Reddit\'s API using the **Python PRAW** package to collect data about posts, comments, and users on r/conservative, r/politics, and r/neutralnews.

I used **matplotlib** to create graphs for the paper. \n\n' +
